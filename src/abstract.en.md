The touch operation with a smartwatch has a problem that
it is difficult to select a small target.
In this paper, I propose ThumbSurface,
an one-handed input technique
using sliding-thumb gesture on the side of the fist.
I implemented a prototype that detects the position of the second joint of the thumb
by infrared camera fixed on the wrist.
In the preliminary experiments,
the relationship between the point touched by the thumb
and the coordinates of the second joint of the thumb was examined.
